# Simple HTML and CSS onepage - My first project :)

This marks the initiation of my journey with the technologies **HTML** and **CSS**. I undertook this project during the 'Complete Front-end' course at Danki Code. I vividly recall an amusing incident during the development of this simple site – a small comma, accidentally placed in the style coding, led me to lose approximately **3 hours**. Yes! The entire flow of the style file (.css) was disrupted by a single comma, leaving the site completely devoid of any style. Imagine the despair—everything was looking good, styled, and in a *blink*, all the style **DISAPPEARED**! For those who haven't experienced it yet, be prepared for such adventures in coding! heheheheheh <3

## Overview:
- A simple Landing Page layout
- Responsive Design
- Manipulation of images, texts, and fonts
- Application of basic styling techniques
- Use of Float and Display inline-block
- Relevant comments in the code (.html + .css)

<h4>NOTE: I have provided both Responsive and Non-Responsive versions for you to compare and study. This way, you can organically understand the essence of responsive design.</h4>

<h3>Happy Studying!</h3>
